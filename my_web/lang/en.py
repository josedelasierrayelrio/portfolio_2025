    In my thirties I decided to drastically change my career path to dedicate myself to my passion: gamedev. 
    I ended up enrolling in a Higher Technician in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), but I am still training as a videogame, frontend and UI/UX designer. """,
    "more_about_me": """
    I enrolled in an advanced degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) and there I discovered that I am passionate about graphic design focused on the user interface and the study to improve the user experience in the use of applications. 
    Before I started programming, I worked in many different jobs: I was a waiter for eight years, a plumber, a gardener, a palm tree worker and I have even been a tutor for neurodivergent children. 
    But my favourite jobs have always been as a cultural analyst and writer for videogame websites, which I did for a few years. You can listen to my podcast about literature La Biblioteca Olvidada, and read my articles in OrgulloGamers.
    Now I'm open to job offers while I keep training myself in many fields such as UX/UI, web architecture, videogame development, and frontend. """,
